# Software Description

## Objective

Design a simple 2048 game.

## Core Features

The game board should be divided into a 4x4 grid.
Players can control the game using the arrow keys on the keyboard.
Automatically generate two random tiles ("2" or "4") on the board at the start of the game.
Tiles move in the direction pressed (up, down, left, or right) and combine according to the game rules.
A new tile ("2" or "4") is generated in an empty cell after each valid move.
Detect and display a "Game Over" message when no more moves are possible.
Save the current game state (board layout and score) to a local text file.
Load a saved game state from a local text file to continue gameplay.
Keep track of the player's score during the game.

## Language

Use python to develop a pygame application.

### Data Storage
