# Software Description

## Objective

Develop a Jumping Frog game. You must design a GUI.

## Core Features

1. The player controls a frog that must jump between platforms that are positioned at various heights on the screen.
2. The player can move the frog left or right using the arrow keys or WASD keys to position it before jumping to the next platform.
3. The frog automatically jumps forward when the player presses the jump button (spacebar or another key). The player can control the jump direction and distance to land on platforms.
4. The platforms move horizontally or vertically, and the player must time the jumps to land on them, avoiding falling into the water below.
5. If the frog falls into the water, the game ends, and the player must restart from the beginning.
6. The goal is to jump as many times as possible without falling. Each successful landing on a platform adds to the player's score.
7. The game features a timer that tracks how long the player can keep the frog jumping without falling into the water.
