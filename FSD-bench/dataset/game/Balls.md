# Software Description

## Objective

Develop a Battle of Balls Game

## Core Features

The player’s ball remains at the center of the screen, while other balls move relative to the player's ball.
The player can move their ball using the up, down, left, and right arrow keys.
When the player’s ball collides with a smaller enemy ball, the player’s ball grows in size, and the smaller ball is consumed.
The game ends if the player’s ball is consumed by another ball.
Initialize the player's ball and four enemy balls. The player’s ball is initially larger than the enemy balls.
Enemy balls (non-player) will spawn on the map and are smaller than the player’s ball.
