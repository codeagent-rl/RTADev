# Software Description

## Objective

Develop a Color Swap Challenge game. You must design a GUI.

## Core Features

1. The player controls a grid of colored blocks, swapping adjacent blocks to create matches of three or more blocks of the same color.
2. The objective is to clear the board by eliminating a certain number of blocks within a limited number of moves.
3. Matches are automatically cleared when three or more blocks of the same color are aligned horizontally or vertically.
4. The game includes multiple levels with increasing difficulty, such as larger grids, more complex block arrangements, and additional color types.
5. Players can earn bonus points by creating combos (clearing multiple matches in a single move) or activating power-ups that clear blocks in specific patterns.
6. The game tracks the number of moves used to complete each level, and players must complete the level within the move limit.
7. Power-ups can be used strategically to help clear the board, and players can earn or unlock new power-ups as they progress.
8. The game features a scoring system based on the number of blocks cleared, combos achieved, and the number of moves used to complete each level.
