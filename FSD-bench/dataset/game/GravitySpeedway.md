# Software Description

## Objective

Develop a Gravity Speedway game. You must design a GUI.

## Core Features

1. The player controls an anti-gravity vehicle using keyboard arrow keys or a game controller (for movement, acceleration, and steering).
2. The game takes place in space, where players race through challenging tracks filled with obstacles, sharp turns, and varying terrain.
3. Players can choose from a variety of futuristic vehicles, each with unique handling, acceleration, and top speed characteristics.
4. The vehicles utilize anti-gravity technology, allowing players to maintain momentum and perform high-speed maneuvers while navigating the race track.
5. The game features realistic physics that simulate anti-gravity effects, affecting the vehicle's handling and speed.
6. The player must avoid obstacles and navigate through tight corners to complete each race track in the fastest time possible.

### Language

Use python to develop a pygame application.
