# Software Description

## Objective

Develop a Number Connect game. You must design a GUI.

## Core Features

1. The player connects numbers in a sequence to form a continuous path.
2. The game board consists of a grid of numbered tiles, and the player must connect the tiles in numerical order, starting from the first number.
3. The player can only move horizontally or vertically to the adjacent tiles (no diagonal movements allowed).
4. The path must form a continuous line without breaking, and the player cannot revisit any tile once itâ€™s been used.
5. The game offers multiple levels with increasing difficulty, where the grid size and number of tiles increase.
6. The game includes a timer to challenge players to complete the path within a certain time.
