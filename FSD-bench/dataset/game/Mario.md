# Software Description

## Objective

Develop a Super Mario game.

## Core Features

Mario can move left, right, and jump using the arrow keys.
Mario interacts with blocks: when hit, a mushroom appears.
Mushrooms move left and fall to the ground. If Mario touches the mushroom, it disappears and adds to the score.
Enemies move left and right randomly. If Mario touches an enemy, he loses.
Marioâ€™s goal is to reach the flagpole at the end of the game. When Mario touches the flagpole, the game ends.
Game settings:

There is a ground where Mario and enemies can stand and walk.
A single block appears above Mario's starting position, and hitting it releases a mushroom.
The score increases by 1 every second. It increases by 100 when Mario hits a block, by 1000 when Mario touches a mushroom, and by 10000 when Mario reaches the flagpole.
