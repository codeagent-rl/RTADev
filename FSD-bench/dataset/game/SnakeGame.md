# Software Description

## Objective

Develop a Snake Game. You must design a GUI.

## Core Features

1. The player controls a snake on the screen using the arrow keys (up, down, left, right).
2. The objective is to eat the food that randomly appears on the screen, causing the snake to grow longer with each piece of food eaten.
3. The player must avoid hitting the walls of the screen or the snake’s own body. If the snake collides with either, the game ends.
4. The game includes a scoring system that increases with each piece of food consumed, reflecting the length of the snake.
5. The game features increasing difficulty as the snake grows longer, with the player needing to avoid a larger body while navigating through the screen.
6. The player can pause and resume the game, with a pause menu displaying the score and a restart option.
7. The game ends when the player hits a wall or collides with the snake’s body, and the final score is displayed.
