# Software Description

## Objective

Develop a Memory Game. You must design a GUI.

## Core Features

1. The game consists of a grid of face-down cards. Each card has a matching pair, and the cards are shuffled randomly at the start of the game.
2. The player can flip two cards at a time by clicking on them with the mouse. The goal is to find matching pairs of cards.
3. If the two flipped cards are a match, they remain face-up. If they do not match, they are turned face-down again after a brief delay.
4. The player continues flipping cards until all pairs have been matched and the board is cleared.
5. The game includes a timer that tracks the time it takes to find all matching pairs, encouraging players to complete the game as quickly as possible.
6. The player can restart the game at any time, and the game will reshuffle the cards and reset the timer.
7. The game includes a scoring system that awards points based on the time it takes to finish, with faster completions earning higher scores.
