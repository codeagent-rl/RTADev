# Software Description

## Objective

Develop a Flappy Bird Clone. You must design a GUI.

## Core Features

1. The player controls a bird that constantly falls due to gravity. The player can make the bird flap by clicking the mouse or pressing any key on the keyboard to make the bird move upward.
2. The objective is to navigate the bird through a series of pipes that appear from the right side of the screen. The pipes are spaced vertically, and the player must avoid hitting them.
3. The pipes move from right to left, and the bird must pass through the gap between the pipes without touching the pipes themselves.
4. The game includes a scoring system where each time the bird successfully passes through a set of pipes, the player earns one point.
5. The game features increasing difficulty, with pipes moving faster as the player scores more points.
6. The game ends when the bird collides with a pipe or falls to the ground, and the final score is displayed.
7. The player can restart the game at any time after the game ends to attempt to beat their high score.
