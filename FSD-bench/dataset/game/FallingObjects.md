# Software Description

## Objective

Develop a Catch the Falling Objects game. You must design a GUI.

## Core Features

1. The player controls a basket or container at the bottom of the screen, using the left and right arrow keys to move it horizontally.
2. The objective is to catch the falling objects that drop from the top of the screen. Each object caught increases the player's score.
3. The player must avoid missing the falling objects. If an object hits the ground (without being caught), it will be counted as a missed object.
4. The game features a scoring system based on how many objects the player successfully catches.
5. The game ends if the player misses a certain number of objects (e.g., 3 missed objects), or after a set amount of time, depending on the mode chosen.
