# Software Description

## Objective

Develop a Space Invaders game. You must design a GUI.

## Core Features

1. The player controls a spaceship at the bottom of the screen using the left and right arrow keys to move and the spacebar to shoot.
2. The objective is to destroy all the alien enemies that descend from the top of the screen by shooting them with the spaceship's lasers.
3. The alien enemies move horizontally across the screen and gradually descend lower with each movement, becoming more difficult to avoid as they get closer to the player.
4. The player must avoid being hit by the alien enemies' projectiles, which they fire from the top of the screen. If the player is hit, the game ends.
5. The player can destroy enemy projectiles by shooting them or avoiding them altogether.
6. The game ends when all enemies are destroyed or the player is hit by an alien projectile.
