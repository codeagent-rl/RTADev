# Software Description

## Objective

Develop a Dodge the Falling Blocks game. You must design a GUI.

## Core Features

1. The player controls a small character at the bottom of the screen, moving it left or right using the arrow keys.
2. The objective is to avoid falling blocks that drop from the top of the screen. If the player collides with a block, the game ends.
3. The falling blocks appear randomly and move straight down the screen, increasing in speed as the player survives longer.
4. The game features a scoring system that tracks the amount of time the player has survived. The longer the player survives, the higher the score.
5. The player must dodge the blocks by moving left or right, but the character cannot move vertically.
6. The game ends when the player collides with a falling block, and the final score is displayed.
