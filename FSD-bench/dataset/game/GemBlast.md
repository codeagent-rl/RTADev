## Objective

Develop a Gem Blast game. You must design a GUI.

## Core Features

2. The objective is to clear the board by eliminating gems in matches of three or more.
3. The game board consists of a grid, and players can swap gems horizontally or vertically to create valid matches.
4. Matches are automatically cleared when three or more gems of the same color are aligned, and new gems fall into the grid to replace cleared ones.

6. The game includes a timer limit to  players challengeto complete the level within certain constraints.
7. Players can earn bonus points through combos or chain reactions, where multiple matches occur in one move.
