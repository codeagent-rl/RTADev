# Software Description

## Objective

Design a Single-Player Tank Battle Game

## Core Features

The game is played on a 20x20 grid (no grid lines visible).
The player's tank is yellow, enemy tanks are silver, and obstacles are brown.
The player moves the tank with the arrow keys and fires bullets with the 'Enter' key.
There are two fixed enemy tanks that shoot in four directions (up, down, left, right).
Both the player and enemies have health points (200 for each).
When hit by a bullet, the player loses 10 health, and enemies lose 100 health.
When health reaches zero, the tank is destroyed.
Destroying an enemy tank earns the player 200 points.
The game ends when the playerâ€™s tank is destroyed or all enemies are destroyed, showing the player's score.
