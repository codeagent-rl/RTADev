## Objective

Develop a Shape Shifter game where players rearrange geometric shapes (squares, triangles, circles) to match a target pattern.

## Core Features

The game must allow players to rearrange numbered tiles on a grid by sliding them horizontally or vertically.

The game must allow players to save their progress at any point, enabling them to resume from where they left off.
The game must provide hints to players when they request help, offering suggestions on possible moves to aid in solving the puzzle.
The game must shuffle the tiles at the start of a new game to create a random arrangement of the numbered tiles.
The game must confirm with players before saving progress to prevent unintentional saves.
The game must allow players to reset the puzzle to the initial shuffled state if they wish to restart.
The game must provide visual feedback when a tile is successfully slid into its correct position to indicate progress.
The game must include a user interface that clearly displays the current state of the puzzle, including the grid layout and available tiles.
