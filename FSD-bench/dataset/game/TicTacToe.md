# Software Description

## Objective

Develop a Tic-Tac-Toe game. You must design a GUI.

## Core Features

1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, where each player takes turns to place either an "X" or an "O" on an empty cell in the grid.
2. The objective is to form a continuous line of three matching symbols ("X" or "O") either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
3. The game alternates turns between two players. The first player uses "X", and the second player uses "O".
4. The game includes a check for a winner after each move. If a player successfully places three matching symbols in a row, they win the game.
5. If the grid is filled and no player has formed a line, the game ends in a draw.
6. The game provides feedback at the end, displaying whether the first player (X) or the second player (O) won or if the game ended in a draw.
7. Players can restart the game after a match is over to play again.
8. The game includes a simple timer that tracks the duration of the match.
