# Software Description

## Objective

Develop a racing game.

## Core Features

The game interface features a three-lane route, with a few obstacles on each lane ,but not all three lanes will have obstacles simultaneously.
The three lanes at the starting point are free of obstacles.Display the vehicle's speed and the distance traveled in the top right corner of the interface.
Car should be controllable by the player using the arrow keys (up, down, left, right), to speed up, speed down and shifts to an adjacent lane.
In the game interface, the vehicle remains stationary while the obstacles move backward, simulating the vehicle's forward movement.
When the "s" is pressed the car should stop (set the speed to 0) .
There are two types of obstacles. One causes the vehicle to slow down upon contact, while the other immediately ends the game.

## Language

Use python to develop a pygame application.
