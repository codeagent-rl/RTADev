## Core Features

The player controls a paddle using the left and right arrow keys.

Each brick starts with 3 lives. When hit by the ball, a brick splits into two smaller bricks, each with 1 less life.
When a brickâ€™s life reaches 0, it disappears.
The game starts once the player presses the left or right arrow key.
Bricks are arranged at the top of the window, and the paddle is placed at the bottom.
The ball is launched from the center of the window and moves upwards to hit the bricks.
