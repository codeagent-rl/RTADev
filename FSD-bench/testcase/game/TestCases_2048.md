### Black Box Unit Test Cases  

#### Functionalities 1. Initialize Game Board  
- **Step**: Start a new game which initializes the 4x4 game board.  
  **Expectation**: The game board is created successfully with all cells empty or containing the initial values (e.g., two '2' tiles).  

#### Functionalities 2. Move Tiles Up  
- **Step**: Press the up arrow key to move the tiles up.  
  **Expectation**: Tiles are combined appropriately, and the game board updates correctly to reflect the new positions and values of the tiles.  

#### Functionalities 3. Move Tiles Down  
- **Step**: Press the down arrow key to move the tiles down.  
  **Expectation**: Tiles are combined appropriately, and the game board updates correctly to reflect the new positions and values of the tiles.  

#### Functionalities 4. Move Tiles Left  
- **Step**: Press the left arrow key to move the tiles left.  
  **Expectation**: Tiles are combined appropriately, and the game board updates correctly to reflect the new positions and values of the tiles.  

#### Functionalities 5. Move Tiles Right  
- **Step**: Press the right arrow key to move the tiles right.  
  **Expectation**: Tiles are combined appropriately, and the game board updates correctly to reflect the new positions and values of the tiles.  

#### Functionalities 6. Generate New Tile  
- **Step**: After making a valid move, check for the generation of a new tile.  
  **Expectation**: A '2' or '4' tile is randomly generated and placed in an empty space on the board.  

#### Functionalities 7. Check Game Over Condition  
- **Step**: Fill the board without any possible moves left.  
  **Expectation**: The game over state is triggered, and an appropriate message is displayed to the user.  

#### Functionalities 8. Save Game State  
- **Step**: Save the game state to a local text file during gameplay.  
  **Expectation**: The game state is correctly written to the file, and can be loaded successfully later.  

#### Functionalities 9. Load Game State  
- **Step**: Load a saved game state from a local text file.  
  **Expectation**: The game board is restored to its previous state as per the saved file, with all tile positions and values intact.
