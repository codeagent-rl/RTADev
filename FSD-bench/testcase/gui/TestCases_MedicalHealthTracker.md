# **Black Box Unit Test Cases**

### **Functionalities 1. Input Daily Activities**

​	•	**Step**: Input valid daily activities (e.g., walking, cooking, reading) with a time duration.

**Expectation**: The activities are saved successfully and displayed in the activity log.



### **Functionalities 2. Record Exercise Routines**

​	•	**Step**: Log a valid exercise routine (e.g., running, weightlifting) with duration and intensity.

**Expectation**: The routine is saved successfully and added to the exercise log.



### **Functionalities 3. Log Sleep Patterns**

​	•	**Step**: Log a valid sleep duration and time (e.g., 10:00 PM to 6:00 AM).

**Expectation**: The sleep pattern is saved and reflected in the sleep log.



### **Functionalities 4. Track Nutrition Intake**

​	•	**Step**: Input valid nutrition details (e.g., food item, calories, and portion size).

**Expectation**: The nutrition entry is saved and displayed in the nutrition log.



### **Functionalities 5. Monitor Stress Levels**

​	•	**Step**: Log a valid stress level on a predefined scale (e.g., 1 to 10) with an optional comment.

**Expectation**: The stress level is saved and displayed in the stress log.



### **Functionalities 6. Provide Visualizations for Health Trends Analysis**

​	•	**Step**: View visualizations for daily activities, exercise routines, sleep patterns, nutrition intake, and stress levels.

**Expectation**: The software generates charts or graphs based on the logged data and displays them correctly.
